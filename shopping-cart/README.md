# Sample shopping cart by Árpád Csikos, based on create-react-app

During the task a json server should work, which is included in the package, but should be started separately in the server folder (separate package)

### `cd server`

### `npm i`

### `npm run products`

Then back to the root (I mean the root of my package), where I also npm install

### `npm i`

### `npm run start`

## PORTS at the project

Thre server **:3003** (http://localhost:3003/)

Thre application **:3001** (http://localhost:3001/)

# Good luck!
